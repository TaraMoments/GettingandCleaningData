## About run\_analysis.R
This file run\_analysis.R is the R script that merges train and test data sets of human activity recognition using smartphones. To make sure this R script runs properly, the Samsung data need to be in the working directory. The output is the tidy data set requested by the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data, which is stored by  human\_activity\_recognition\_using\_smartphones.txt. 

## About human\_activity\_recognition\_using\_smartphones.txt

This is the tidy data set requested by the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data, which can be obtained by running run\_analysis.R with the Samsung data in the working directory. 

## About CodeBook.md
This file describes the variables and the data stored by human\_activity\_recognition\_using\_smartphones.txt. It also describes the work that I performed to clean up the Samsung data in order to get the final tidy data set.
